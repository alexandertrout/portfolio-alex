            As a carbon literacy trainer I worked to deliver sessions to fellow students at MMU, these workshops covered climate science, the impacts of climate change, and current mitigation strategies. Delivering training to students resulted in them becoming certified carbon literate, and allowed me to further develop my leadership, communication, and presentation skills. I am glad to have had the opportunity to influence others, and to provide them with some personal engagement in understanding climate change and sustainability.
